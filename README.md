CarbonScribe is an end-to-end platform where regenerative agriculture and forestry projects issue carbon credits as Stellar Assets, which corporations can purchase and instantly retire with transparent, on-chain proof. We're building the Internet of Carbon—a digital public utility that transforms ecosystem services into programmable financial assets with real-time environmental telemetry.

## 🌍 The Carbon Market Problem
Current carbon markets are opaque, inefficient, and lack trust:
- **Verification delays**: 6-18 months for credit issuance and verification
- **Opaque pricing**: No real-time price discovery, limited liquidity
- **Double counting risks**: Inadequate global tracking systems
- **High transaction costs**: 30-60% of credit value lost to intermediaries
- **Limited accessibility**: Small projects in developing nations excluded
- **Static credits**: Fixed value regardless of changing environmental conditions

## ✨ CarbonScribe's Solution
Real-time, transparent carbon ecosystem:
- **Instant tokenization**: Convert verified carbon removals to Stellar Assets in minutes
- **Dynamic pricing**: Credit values adjust based on satellite-verified ecosystem health
- **Global interoperability**: Bridges to Verra, Gold Standard, and UN registries
- **Automated compliance**: Built-in regulatory checks for Article 6, CORSIA, CBAM
- **Direct financing**: Forward sales and derivatives for project pre-financing
- **Public transparency**: Every credit and retirement visible on public ledger
